<h1 id="luzfaltex-code-of-conduct">LuzFaltex Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in LuzFaltex-managed communities, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>
<p>Our communities strive to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient:</strong> Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken language.</li>
<li><strong>Be Welcoming:</strong> Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic status, education level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical disability.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>violent threats or language,</li>
<li>discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language,</li>
<li>posting sexually explicit or violent material,</li>
<li>posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information (&quot;doxing&quot;),</li>
<li>insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs,</li>
<li>behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention, or</li>
<li>advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understand disagreements:</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the viewpoints of others and resolve the differences constructively.</li>
<li>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>This code applies to all LuzFaltex communities, sites, and services as per your agreement with the <a href="tacos-overview.html">TACOS</a>. This code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include an official project e-mail address, posing via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the project itself.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-code-of-conduct-issues">Reporting Code of Conduct Issues</h2>
<p>We encourage all community members to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting a community moderator or staff member. Your report will be handled in accordance with the issue resolution process described below.</p>
<p>In your report, please include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names (real or usernames) of any individuals involved, including witnesses.</li>
<li>Your account of what occurred and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly visible record (such as a forum post), please include a link or a screenshot of the content.</li>
<li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>All reports will be reviewed by a community moderator and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the moderator may seek insight from other members of the moderation team. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the reviewing moderator may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.</p>
<h2 id="resolution-process">Resolution Process</h2>
<p>A report will kick off the following process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your message will be acknowledged within one business day.</li>
<li>Within the following business day, a moderator from the community moderation team or the LuzFaltex moderation team will review your concern. The moderator will not be anyone directly involved with the issue that has been raised.</li>
<li>From there, the moderator will work with you and the others involved to come to a conclusion. While issue complexity varies, the goal is to resolve issues within five working days.</li>
<li>All communication will be confidential with very limited circulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-the-moderation-team-work">How does the moderation team work?</h2>
<p>Beyond the norms and values set out by the Code of Conduct, moderators operate under the following principals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less is more</strong> - As much as possible, let the community work it out. It is much better to have communities self-correct than to have outsiders come in and &quot;fix&quot; problems.</li>
<li><strong>Equality</strong> - Contribution value or status in the community are not relevant to the review. Key people do not have more rights (either to abuse or to be protected from abuse) than others in the community.</li>
<li><strong>Independence</strong> - Moderators must act and be seen to act as a neutral party.</li>
</ul>
<p>*This code of conduct is based on the <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/">Microsoft Open Source Code of
Conduct</a>.</p>
