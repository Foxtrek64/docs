# LuzFaltex Privacy Policy

LuzFaltex is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors, members, and volunteers who use our our websites and services (herein "services"). LuzFaltex has established this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our services and how it is used, as well as protections for our members' personal information.

In this Policy, "LuzFaltex" refers to LuzFaltex staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants.

**LuzFaltex does not sell or rent member or website visitor information under any circumstances**, and we do not share member or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law.

This domain (luzfaltex.com) complies with user opt-outs from tracking via the "Do Not Track" or ["DNT" header](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/). This file will always be posted via HTTPS at [https://www.LuzFaltex.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt](https://www.LuzFaltex.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt) to indicate this fact.

## Security

LuzFaltex employs industry standard security measures to protect from the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. LuzFaltex has turned on [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) by default, and has further strengthened security by enabling [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) or "HSTS" preloading. HSTS preloading informs your internet browser that it should ONLY connect to LuzFaltex.com through HTTPS.

Our security certificates are provided by [Let's Encryptâ„¢](https://letsencrypt.org/), a group dedicated to bringing security and ease-of-use to the internet. Let's Encrypt is a trademark of the Internet Security Research Group. All rights reserved.

## Information Gathered by LuzFaltex's Site

**Cookies:** We do not use persistent ID cookies on this site except when you click "remember me" or are logged in. We use session cookies on certain portions of the website. Session cookies expire when you close your browser.

**Voluntarily Submitted Information:** In addition, LuzFaltex collects and retains information you voluntarily submit to us. It is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much information you provide. If you choose to become a member, we may ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and birthday, and retain that information.

Additional information, such as (but not limited to) gender, hobbies and interests, and additional contact options, may be collected and stored. This information will be retained until manually removed by the user or by administrative action, such as enforcement of the TACOS or account closure.

From time to time, we may ask for personal information on other portions of the site, such as asking you to participate in a contest, or when you provide feedback or comments.

Additionally, any information you release on the forums in the form of posts may be retained as long as that post is in existence. A post is defined as any single comment, whether starting a new thread or replying to an existing thread, or commenting on a user's profile or any other location. Modifying the post will not remove this information (edit history is retained so you can roll back if you make a mistake). If you wish to remove an entire thread or post, mark it as trash. An automated trash collector will collect and dispose of trashed threads after having been in the trash for 30 days.

Personally identifiable information that is automatically collected by our system (e.g. IP addresses in access logs) will be automatically deleted after seven days, unless retaining that information is necessary for the purpose of conducting an audit or diagnosing and preventing an attack. This cleanup policy does not include voluntarily submitted information placed on your profile (such as contact information) or anything posted in the forum or other sites. If personally identifiable information was requested from you by a member of staff when providing support, the personally identifiable information will be scrubbed from the thread after its use has expired. Members of staff will NEVER ask you for your password. Please do not give your password to anyone, even if they say they are a LuzFaltex employee.

Please note that personally identifiable information, even after deleted, may remain on backup media. If a user is banished by IP, their IP address may remain in the system for the duration of the banishment.

## LuzFaltex's Use of Information

In general, LuzFaltex uses the information provided by you to provide and maintain a collective community experience.

**Member Information:** We use member information to process and manage your membership. On occasion, LuzFaltex may send you emails regarding urgent updates. We will never send you ads or malicious content, though the message may contain names of third parties responsible for providing us with a service. If you receive an email from any email address @LuzFaltex.com with an ad or with malicious content, please forward the email to [security@luzfaltex.com](mailto:security@luzfaltex.com). Alternatively, you may send an email to that address with information about the ad or malicious content that was sent. Screenshots of the content are appreciated and recommended, but are not required. However, we are not a reporting agency for emails. Do not send us malicious emails sent from domains other than LuzFaltex.com.

For the avoidance of doubt...
Do not send mail regarding user@example.com
Do send mail regarding user@LuzFaltex.com

**Other Activities:** We may run surveys, contests, or similar activities through this site. Such information will be used for the purposes for which it was collected and will only be collected if you opt-in. To opt-in, you must explicitly share the information with us - we will not collect it from your profile or threads.

We use the information provided through our online shop to fulfill your order, and address any problems that might arise.

We also look at technical information to diagnose problems with or consider improvements to our servers or related technologies and to administer LuzFaltex.com and other services we host or provide. We may retain aggregated, anonymous information for extended periods for this purpose. This can be things such as "X users connected this month," but not information such as "Mary Sue at 127.0.0.1 connected 37 times in the last 30 days."

## Third-Party Service Providers to LuzFaltex

LuzFaltex uses Stripe to complete transactions. Please read Stripe's policies for more information. LuzFaltex's service providers may log standard technical information, such as the numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

## Third-Party Services and APIs

LuzFaltex's site also provides links to or interacts with a wide variety of third-party websites, including interactive links to sites like social media or video hosting websites, often via application programming interfaces ([APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api)). LuzFaltex is not responsible for, and does not have control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited via links from or interactions with the LuzFaltex website.

## Disclosure of Your Information

While LuzFaltex endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including:

1. with your explicit consent; or
2. when we have good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.

## Updating or Removing Your Information

You may choose to correct, update, or delete account information you have submitted to us using the account management page. Other information, including but not limited to information disclosed in posts, may remain on the servers until manually deleted by you or through administrative action. If we inadvertently collect more information than intended, we endeavor to delete the extraneous information. However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media.

## Changes to Our Policies

LuzFaltex's privacy policy may change from time to time. While we will make a best effort to inform you of updates, we are not required to do so, and may change or update this notice at any time without notice.

Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by LuzFaltex in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security. Information collected by LuzFaltex will be maintained for a length of time appropriate to our needs.

If any part of this agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable. Links to all of these documents will be available at the bottom of all pages on the Website.
